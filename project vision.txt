Project Vision: API Testing Automation Tool with ML

This project aims to build a lightweight automation tool that enables intelligent testing of APIs by incorporating machine learning.

Key Objectives:
- Accept API request data via a UI or JSON interface.
- Automatically analyze or predict expected responses using ML.
- Offer status reporting, logs, and analysis of passed/failed test cases.
- Eventually integrate learning from past tests to optimize new ones.

**Phase 1 Goal**: Build a working Flask API that accepts POST requests, runs dummy test logic, and returns a structured response.

**Future Enhancements**:
- ML integration for smart response validation.
- Authentication/token handling.
- UI for manual + automated test trigger.
